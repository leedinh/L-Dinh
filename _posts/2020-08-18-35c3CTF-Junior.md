Hello everyone, long time for no writeup so i come up with this post for 5 challenges of 35c3ctf(junior), which is my task last month. These challenges almost in heap concept and this is also the first time i work with heap too (⊙_⊙;). So i hope i will make nothing wrong.


**You can get full pwn challenge of this ctf here>[(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞](https://github.com/leedinh/InfoSec/tree/master/35c3ctf_juni)<**

# 19996
This is the basic buffer over flow chal. All you need to do is overflowing with payload 0x418 and overwrite the return address with spwan_shell.

# Poet
There are two ways to solve this chal:
* First, overflow the variable $poem_name then redirect to spawn_shell, the same **1996**.
<br>
* Second, We will overflow the variable of point and set it to 100000 then get shell by the code flow.

 Let see in the bss of binary the layout is **poet_name** > **poet_author** > **point**. U can use both poet_name and poet_author to overflow point but **$name** is also call in **rate_reward** and it will cause *BOF*. <br>
 So let choose **poet_author** with ``cyclic(68) + hex(100000)`` (∪.∪ )...zzz

#### Let step in some more complicated chals.

# Sum
This problem is quiet hard for me. But i learnt lots of things from it.
## Overview
This chal has a spawn_shell function, all u need to do is redirect the code to it.
### Checksec

The cannary is on that mean you can't overflow the return address of main @@.
<br>Btw the prompt of this challenge:
![pwn1intro](img/sum_2.png)
It will get in a number and maybe allocate the space from this value then the menu for some actions will show up.

## Bug
![pwn1intro](img/sum_3.png)<br>![pwn1intro](img/sum_4.png)
Let have a look at **calloc()**, it come up with 2 parameter ***calloc(size_t,int_64)*** and we will input the **size_t** number.<br>
`` The datatype size_t is unsigned integral type``
<br>So what if we input -1, it will cause ***integer overflow*** and it convert to **max_size_t=0xffffffffffffffff**.
<br>Then, it passes the **size_t** into **calloc**-> **calloc(-1) =0** and one more bug that the program not check if the **calloc()** ret **NULL**, so maybe we can do something with these bugs.

## Exploit
Let check for get(), set() method of the program :
<br>
**SET()**<br>
<pre><code>mov     rdx, [rsp+58h+var_38] 
mov     [r12+rax*8], rdx</code></pre>
 
 **GET()**<br>
 <pre><code>mov     rdx, [r12+rax*8]
 lea     rsi, aLd</code></pre>
   
 In which, ***r12*** is the return pointer of the **calloc()**, ***rax*** is the index the we input.
 So as you can see, what if we set **r12=0** and **rax** can be controll, yah we can read and write arbitary (╯▽╰ ).
