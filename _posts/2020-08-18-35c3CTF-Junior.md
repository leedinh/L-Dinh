Hello everyone, long time for no writeup so i come up with this post for 5 challenges of 35c3ctf(junior), which is my task last month. These challenges almost in heap concept and this is also the first time i work with heap too (⊙_⊙;). So i hope i will make noothing wrong.


## You can get full pwn challenge of this ctf here>[(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞](https://github.com/leedinh/InfoSec/tree/master/35c3ctf_juni)<

# 19996
This is the basic buffer over flow chal. All you need to do is overflowing with payload 0x418 and overwrite the return address with spwan_shell.

# Poet
There are two ways to solve this chal:
1. I overflow the variable $poem_name then redirect to spawn_shell, the same **1996**.
</br>
2. We will overflow the variable of point and set it to 100000 then get shell by the code flow.

 Let see in the bss of binary the layout is poet_name > poet_author > point. U can use both poet_name and poet_author to overflow point but $name is also call in rate_reward and it will cause bof. So let choose poet_author with 68 byte payload + hex(100000).
 
(∪.∪ )...zzz

## Let step in some more complicated chals.

# Sum
This problem is quiet hard for me. But i learnt lots of things from it.
## Overview
This chal has a spawn_shell function, all u need to do is redirect the code to it.
### Checksec

The cannary is on that mean you can overflow the return address of main @@.
Btw the prompt of this challenge
![pwn1intro](img/sum_2.png)
It will get in a number and maybe allocate the space from this value then the menu for some actions will show up.

## Bug
![pwn1intro](img/sum_3.png)</br>![pwn1intro](img/sum_4.png)
Let have a look at **calloc()**, it come up with 2 parameter *calloc(size_t,int_64)* and we will input the size_t number.
`` The datatype size_t is unsigned integral type``
So what if we input -1, it will cause integer overflow and it convert to max_size_t=0xffffffffffffffff.
